#### **testrpc**

testrpc is a fast Ethereum RPC client for testing and development

You will notice that `testrpc`has generated 10 addresses with fake ETH you can use without the need to worry about them. This is how `testrpc`works by default, but you can make a custom initialization following the documentation. Itâ€™s important to mention that `testrp`state is volatile, that is every time you close it, the state of your node and accounts will be cleared.

```
npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
```

```
testrpc
```
