### Mnemonic Code Converter

You can enter an existing BIP39 mnemonic, or generate a new random one. Typing your own twelve words will probably not work how you expect, since the words require a particular structure \(the last word is a checksum\).

For more info see the[BIP39 spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).
