#### PROOF OF WORK {#proof-of-work}

There are some ways to tie your coin supply to a mathematical formula. One of the simplest ways would be to make it a "merged mining" with Ether, meaning that anyone who finds a block on Ethereum would also get a reward from your coin, given that anyone calls the reward function on that block. You can do it using the [special keyword coinbase](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties) that refers to the miner who finds the block.
