### Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\)

The EVM allows Ethereum nodes to actually store and process data in exchange for payment, responding to real-world events and allowing a lot of new opportunities to support on-chain applications that were never before available to developers and real-world users.

### Ethereum smart contract

Smart-contract are a way for people all across the globe to do business with each other even if they don't speak the same language or use the same currency.

* Have data and code
* Have balance and address
* Functions invoked by sending transactions
* Ouput returned after transactions mined

### Solidity language

Solidity language itself is a tool that we use to generate machine-level code that can execute on the EVM, it's a language with a complier which takes our high-level human-readable code and breaks it down into simple instructions like "put data into a register", "add data from two registers", "jump back to instruction at memory point xxxx", which form the basis of any microprcessor executable program.

The constructor is only invoked only once when the contract that is first deployed on the Ethereum block chain. You can only declare a single contructor for a contract.
